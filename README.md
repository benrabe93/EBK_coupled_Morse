# EBK_coupled_Morse

The Einstein–Brillouin–Keller (EBK) Quantization method is an improvement over the Bohr-Sommerfeld Quantization and allows for coordinate-independent semi-classical energy quantization using regular classical trajectories. In this repository I treat two linearly aligned, kinetically coupled Morse oscillators, simulating a simplified tri-atomic molecule.
